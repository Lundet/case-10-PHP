# Fullstack PHP Application

## Overview

The Fullstack PHP Application is a project designed to allow users to create, edit, and publish web pages with text and images. This application leverages a relational database for data management and is built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Docker is used for containerization and deployment.

## What I Have Learned

### **Database Management**

- **Database Design**: Developed a relational database schema to manage users, pages, and images. Gained experience in creating and managing tables with PHP and MySQL.
- **SQL Queries**: Wrote and optimized SQL queries for CRUD operations. Implemented data validation to ensure data integrity.

### **PHP Development**

- **Backend Integration**: Created PHP scripts to interact with the MySQL database, handling user authentication, page creation, and image management.
- **Session Management**: Implemented PHP sessions for secure login/logout functionality and user-specific page management.

### **Front-End Development**

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized Tailwind CSS for building a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Learned how to leverage utility-first CSS to quickly style components and layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities.

### **Docker and Deployment**

- **Containerization**: Used Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Managed multi-container setups with Docker Compose, including the PHP application and MySQL database.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts. Passwords are securely hashed.
- **Page Management**: Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own pages. Each page can include text and images.
- **Image Management**: Users can upload, edit, and delete images associated with their pages.
- **Public Access**: Visitors can view published pages without needing to log in.

## Conclusion

This project has significantly enhanced my skills in full-stack development, particularly in PHP, SQL, and front-end technologies. Working with Tailwind CSS has improved my ability to design responsive and aesthetically pleasing interfaces efficiently. Additionally, Docker has provided valuable experience in containerization and deployment practices.
